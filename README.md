# cracking-the-coding-interview
My C/C++ solutions to the interview questions in the book "Cracking the Code Interview" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell

-----------------------------------

Please note that I have decided to use common classes, such as:

- LinkedList
- BinaryTree
- Stack
- Utils

This enables me to focus on the solutions, without having to re-write boilerplate code each time.

## Building

Please build using qmake.
