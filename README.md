## Building

Please build using qmake from the command line, or open the .pro in QtCreator. The unit tests can be built using the make command, too.

```
git clone https://github.com/shyal/cracking-the-coding-interview.git
cd cracking-the-coding-interview/projectfiles
qmake cracking-the-coding-interview.pro
```

or simply open the .pro in QtCreator, build and run.

### Chapter 1 - Arrays and Strings

This chapter contains very standard and entry levels on string and array manipulation. I got some interesting from reddit /r/programming saying I should probably use more pointer arithmetic, and less array subscripts. I may take this advice on board and go over these answers again.

### Chapture 2 - Linked Lists

These questions get more interesting. I actually wrote two linked list classes, so I wouldn't have to write as much boilerplate code.

lib/datastructures/LinkedList.h

and

lib/datastructures/DLinkedList.h
