## Building

Please build using qmake from the command line, or open the .pro in QtCreator. The unit tests can be built using the make command, too.

```
git clone https://github.com/shyal/cracking-the-coding-interview.git
cd cracking-the-coding-interview/projectfiles
qmake cracking-the-coding-interview.pro
```

or simply open the .pro in QtCreator, build and run.

### Chapter 1 - Arrays and Strings

This chapter contains very standard and entry level questions on string and array manipulation. I got some interesting feedback from reddit /r/programming saying I should probably use more pointer arithmetic, and less array subscripts. I'm taking this advice on board and will go over these answers again.

### Chapture 2 - Linked Lists

These questions get more interesting. I actually wrote two linked list classes, so I wouldn't have to write as much boilerplate code.

[lib/datastructures/LinkedList.h](lib/datastructures/LinkedList.h)

and

[lib/datastructures/DLinkedList.h](lib/datastructures/DLinkedList.h)
