#include "3.3.h"

// 3.3 Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets too high,
// it might topple. Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a
// new stack when the previous stack exceeds some threshold. Implement
// a data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this. SetOfStacks should
// be composed of several stacks and should create a new stack once the
// previous one exceeds capacity. SetOfStacks.push() and
// SetOfStacks.pop() should behave identically to a single stack
// (that is, pop() should return the same values as it would if there
// were just a single stack). Implement a function popAt(int index)
// which performs a pop operation on a specific sub-stack.
